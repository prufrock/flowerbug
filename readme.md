# About flowerbug-admin
Flowerbug is a site built to administer shops that sells digital goods.

I've been overhauling it from an old project into something crisp and new and shiny. It's currently in that rough stage
where it doesn't fully work and the code is still very much like the old nasty mess. But hey! There's tests so major
refactoring will be starting as soon as I get all of the old code in place.

It currently uses v2 of the PHP SDK due to a need for SimpleDb support and to make it easier to move the old code over:
- [aws-sdk-php v2](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/v2/guide/).
